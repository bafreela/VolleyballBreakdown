# VolleyballBreakdown

This project is designed to take an imported csv file that contains volleyball player positions and rankings, and creates two evenly matched teams.
The code takes into account a player's position as well as their skillset when breaking up the teams. I currently run the club volleyball team at Denison University, and have been working on this project in hopes of using it in my own life. The data was created by me in Microsoft Excel, with the rankings of the players coming from me and the other leaders of our club volleyball team. I wrote this program using python, and used the interface Spyder.
